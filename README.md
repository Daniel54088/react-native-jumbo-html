## API

### `HTMLRenderer`

React component which takes an HTML string and renders it as React Native components.

#### Props

- `html` - string containing the HTML to render
- `mappings` - an object with mappings for tags to React components
- `sheet` - an object with a style sheet, they keys can be tag name or class name selectors

Each component in the `mappings` object will receive the following props:

- `tagName` - name of the tag that's being rendered
- `classList` - an array with the list of class names on the tag
- `attrs` - an object with all the attributes of the tag
- `style` - styles for the component
- `children` - children elements for the component

#### Example

```js
import * as React from 'react';
import { StyleSheet } from 'react-native';
import { HTMLRenderer } from 'react-native-jumbo-html';
import CustomImage from './CustomImage';

const html = `
  <p>Hello world</p>
`;

const mappings = {
  img: CustomImage
};

export default function App() {
  return (
    <HTMLRenderer
      html={html}
      sheet={styles}
      mappings={mappings}
    />
  );
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  a: {
    color: 'blue'
  },
  '.red': {
    color: 'red'
  }
});
```

### `RendererMappings`

The default list of mappings. You can reuse the mappings when adding additional functionality and don't have to re-implement the components.
